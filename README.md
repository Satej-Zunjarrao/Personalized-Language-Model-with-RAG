# Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-Pipeline  
Build a personalized language model integrating retrieval systems for domain-specific responses.

# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System  

## Overview  
The **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System** is a Python-based solution designed to create personalized language models by combining a knowledge retrieval component with fine-tuned generative models. The system is capable of providing domain-specific, accurate, and context-aware responses, making it suitable for applications such as customer support, technical documentation, and personalized learning systems.

This project implements a modular and scalable pipeline for data preprocessing, retrieval indexing, model fine-tuning, response generation, API deployment, and performance monitoring.

## Key Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and tokenizes domain-specific text and segments it into retrievable chunks.  
- **Retrieval Indexing**: Creates efficient FAISS-based indices for high-speed retrieval.  
- **Fine-Tuning**: Trains pre-trained language models on domain-specific QA pairs for improved contextual understanding.  
- **RAG Integration**: Combines retrieval and generative components into a cohesive pipeline for real-time responses.  
- **Deployment**: Provides a REST API for real-time query handling using Flask.  
- **Monitoring**: Logs query performance, response accuracy, and latency metrics.

## Modules  

### 1. data_preprocessing.py  
- Cleans and tokenizes domain-specific text.  
- Segments text into retrievable chunks using custom chunk sizes.  

### 2. faiss_indexing.py  
- Generates embeddings for preprocessed chunks using Sentence Transformers.  
- Builds and saves FAISS indices for efficient retrieval of relevant contexts.  

### 3. fine_tune_model.py  
- Fine-tunes pre-trained models (e.g., GPT-2, T5) on domain-specific QA pairs.  
- Saves the fine-tuned model for use in the RAG pipeline.  

### 4. rag_pipeline.py  
- Combines retrieval (FAISS) and generation (fine-tuned language model) into a unified pipeline.  
- Retrieves relevant contexts and generates personalized responses for queries.  

### 5. api_service.py  
- Deploys the RAG pipeline as a REST API using Flask.  
- Handles real-time queries and returns responses in JSON format.  

### 6. monitoring_logging.py  
- Logs query performance, including response accuracy and retrieval latency.  
- Includes decorators for tracking function execution times.  

### 7. config.py  
- Centralized configuration file for paths, model names, and hyperparameters.  
- Simplifies modifications and ensures consistency across modules.  

### 8. utils.py  
- Provides utility functions for directory creation, logging, and similarity calculations.  
- Modular design allows easy reuse across the pipeline.
